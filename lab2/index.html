			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>My name is Will Crowley. I am a third year Film and digital media major. I grew up in Duxbury massachsusetts and have no coding experience other than a general computer science course I took in High school. I am excited to learn more about computer programming arts and explore the possibilities it provides. Bella and I linked up through discord and are both happy to be here in Art-101-01</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create and edit our first HTML and CSS files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I encountered was figuring out how to change the appearence of my html code so that my text appears in paragraphs rather than one long line of text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was helpful in figuring out the works of HTML and CSS files. I found that this type of work is effective because hands on learning is the best way to learn. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We successfully created our own web pages and will now move on to the CSS portion.</p>
